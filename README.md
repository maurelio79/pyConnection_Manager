pyConnection_Manager
====================

Python tabbed terminal to manage ssh connection


This will be a tabbed terminal to manage different connection to linux servers, just like superputty on windows.
I say "will be" because at the moment it's still not :-)
Anyway it's already an esay to use terminal emulator!
