pyConnection_Manager
====================

Python tabbed terminal to manage ssh connection

This will be a tabbed terminal to manage different connection to linux servers, just like superputty on windows.

I say "will be" because at the moment it's still not :-)

Anyway it'a esay usable terminal emulator!
